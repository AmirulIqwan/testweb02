        <p class="about-description">Graduated from Multimedia University, Cyberjaya with a bachelor's degree in Virtual Reality (with honours), my passion lies in game and simulation development using Unity 3D. As a developer, I focus on designing, building, and scripting levels that are both engaging and immersive for players. I believe that great gameplay and narrative are essential to any successful game, and I work hard to ensure that every project I undertake meets those standards. 
        <br><br> As a Unity developer with a passion for immersive technologies, I bring creativity and technical expertise to create engaging virtual, augmented, and mixed reality experiences. I have experienced developing games and applications for a range of platforms and devices, including Oculus, Vive, and HoloLens, and am always eager to learn new skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. With a strong foundation in C#, 3D modeling, and game design principles, I'm confident in my ability to bring innovative ideas to life and make a real impact in the world of VR/AR/XR. Sometimes I also make websites, like this one. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me :) </p>
